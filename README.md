# Telegram-Support-Bot ðŸ’­

**A simple Telegram bot designed to assist with support-related tasks.**

This repository contains the source code for a Telegram Support Bot built using [grammY](https://grammy.dev/), `express`, and `mysql2`. This bot enables streamlined communication between users and support teams on Telegram, offering an efficient way to manage queries, feedback, and support requests directly from a Telegram chat, with features for message forwarding, user blacklisting, and message handling.

## Features

- **Forwarding Messages**: Automatically forwards user messages from private chats to a support group.
- **Responding to Users**: Allows support team members to reply to user messages directly from the support group.
- **Admin Management**: Supports admin commands like `/ban` and `/pardon` to block or unblock users.
- **Webhook Support**: Configured for deployment in a serverless environment using `express` for webhook handling.
- **Database Integration**: Stores user messages and blacklist information in a MariaDB/MySQL database using `mysql2` for direct database queries.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam with customizable rate limits on user messages.
- **i18n Support**: Uses @grammyjs/i18n for multilingual support, making the bot accessible to users worldwide.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Clean and maintainable structure with modularized routes, middlewares, and handlers.
- **Deployable on Vercel**: Configured to run seamlessly on Vercelâ€™s serverless environment with webhook support.

## âš’ Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and set the following variables:

```env
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
SUPPORT_CHAT_ID=your_support_group_id
MYSQL_HOST=your_database_host
MYSQL_PORT=3306 # or your custom port
MYSQL_DATABASE=your_database_name
MYSQL_USERNAME=your_database_user
MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_database_password
PROJECT_USERNAME=your_project_username
```

### Webhook Setup

To deploy the bot using a serverless environment, the webhook must be set up properly. The `express` server listens for incoming updates and passes them to the bot.

## ðŸ“„ Commands

The bot includes the following commands:

- **/start**: Starts interaction with the user. Â¯\\\_(ãƒ„)\_\/Â¯
- **/help**: Provides assistance.
- **/ban**: Bans a user (admin only, for use in support group).
- **/pardon**: Unbans a user (admin only, for use in support group).
